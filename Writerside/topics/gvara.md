# gVARA

gVara is a yield-bearing token that represents your staked Vara in the Guardian Protocol. When you stake your Vara,
you receive gVara in return, which not only reflects your original deposit but also accrues rewards generated by the
staking process over time.

### How it works:

When you stake your Vara on the Guardian Protocol, the system mints gVara tokens equivalent to the amount of Vara 
staked. These gVara tokens are automatically tied to the rewards generated from the staking process. As the protocol 
accrues staking rewards, the value of your gVara increases, reflecting the total amount of staked Vara plus any earned 
rewards.
