# Withdraw

The final step in the staking process is withdrawal. You can withdraw your tokens in the withdrawal section of the 
Guardian dApp.

Once the unstaking process is complete, you can click the claim button to receive your original tokens plus any rewards 
generated by the protocol. Once the withdrawal is claimed, the card will disappear, and your tokens will be reflected in 
your wallet.

When the user clicks the claim button, the proxy withdraws the unbound value across the proxy pallet and simultaneously
sends the withdrawal message to the smart contract. This contract then burns the unstaked gVara tokens to maintain the 
token-to-Vara relationship.
